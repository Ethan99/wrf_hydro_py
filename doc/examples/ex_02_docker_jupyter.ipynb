    "# Running wrfhydropy through docker\n",
    "The first example shows running `wrfhydropy` from the cheyenne machine. This is similar to being on a linux envionment where model compilation is not a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "For developers on laptops and non-linux use cases, the `docker` used as shown here. The prerequisites are \n",
    "* Docker installed\n",
    "* Local version of `wrf_hydro_py` repository\n",
    "* Local version of `wrf_hydro_nwm_public` repository\n",
    "\n",
    "On the host machine:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker pull wrfhydro/dev:conda\n",
    "docker run -it -p 8899:8888 \\\n",
    "    -v /Users/jamesmcc/WRF_Hydro/wrf_hydro_nwm_public:/wrf_hydro_nwm_public \\\n",
    "    -v /Users/jamesmcc/WRF_Hydro/wrf_hydro_py:/wrf_hydro_py \\\n",
    "    wrfhydro/dev:conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will need to customize the paths to `wrf_hydro_py` and `wrf_hydro_nwm_public` on the host side of the volume mounts. Leaving the docker side of the volume mounts will streamline the code below. Note that we are using different ports on host:docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command will enter you into the docker image. In docker, first let's install the mounted `wrfhydropy`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /home/docker\n",
    "python setup.py develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then, to start jupyter lab, execute: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /\n",
    "jupyter-lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the jupyter lab in docker, it will print a URL with a token embedded, like this (dont use this one): \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://(ac61502766bc or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=a824b4cdb345e944d3754f1d5a97d2aedb4b003b2e76e625\n",
    "```\n",
    "To connect to jupyter lab on the host, transform the above URL to the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8899/?token=a824b4cdb345e944d3754f1d5a97d2aedb4b003b2e76e625\n",
    "```\n",
    "(keeping the token the same) and paste it in the browser on your local machine. Note that the port on the local host is not the port indicated by jupyter lab, it's the one we selected in docker."
